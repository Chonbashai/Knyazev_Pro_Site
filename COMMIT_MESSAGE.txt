Fix mobile zoom bug causing black gutter on right side

Fixed issue where pinch-zooming out on mobile caused content to shift left
with a black area appearing on the right half of the screen.

Root causes:
- Use of 100vw (includes scrollbar width) causing horizontal overflow
- Missing background color on html element
- Viewport meta tag missing minimum-scale and viewport-fit

Changes:
- Replaced all max-width: 100vw with max-width: 100% (5 instances)
- Added background: var(--bg) to html element
- Added max-width: 100% to html, body for extra protection
- Updated viewport meta tag on all 5 HTML pages:
  - Added minimum-scale=1.0 to prevent over-zoom-out
  - Added viewport-fit=cover for notched devices
- Added defensive CSS rules (min-width: 100% on html/body)

Files modified:
- assets/styles.css: Core layout and overflow fixes
- index.html: Updated viewport meta tag
- portfolio.html: Updated viewport meta tag
- price.html: Updated viewport meta tag
- founder.html: Updated viewport meta tag
- contact.html: Updated viewport meta tag

Result:
- No horizontal scrollbar at any zoom level
- Content remains properly aligned when zooming
- Background covers entire viewport
- Black gutter no longer appears
- Maintains accessibility (zoom still enabled up to 5x)

Testing:
- Verified all HTML files serve correctly
- Confirmed no 100vw instances remain in CSS
- Validated viewport-fit=cover and minimum-scale in all HTML files
- Ensured background colors are consistent
