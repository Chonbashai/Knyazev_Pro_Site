## Introduction

The interactive features of this Knyazev Pro landing site represent a sophisticated blend of modern web technologies designed to create seamless user experiences across all devices. Built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS, the system emphasizes accessibility, performance, and cross-platform compatibility while maintaining a professional corporate aesthetic.

The interactive elements focus on driving user engagement through intuitive navigation, dynamic content filtering, and streamlined conversion processes. Each feature is carefully crafted to handle the complexities of mobile device interactions while providing desktop users with rich, responsive experiences.

## Mobile Navigation System

The mobile navigation system serves as the primary interface for accessing site content on smaller screens, featuring a hamburger menu toggle with sophisticated state management and accessibility compliance.

### Hamburger Menu Toggle Implementation

The navigation toggle utilizes a clean, minimalist design with CSS transforms for smooth animations and ARIA state management for screen reader compatibility.

```mermaid

Closed --> Active : Click/Tap
Active --> Closed : Click/Tap Outside
Active --> Closed : Click Link
Closed --> [*]
```

The implementation features:
- **CSS Transform Animation**: Three-bar hamburger icon transforms into an X shape using CSS transitions
- **State Management**: Active class toggles on both menu button and navigation container
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
- **Touch Optimization**: `touch-action: manipulation` prevents unwanted browser gestures

### Menu Closing Behavior

The navigation system implements intelligent closing mechanisms to prevent user frustration and ensure predictable behavior.

Start([User Clicks Filter]) --> ValidateClick{Valid Button?}
ValidateClick --> |Yes| RemoveActive[Remove Active Classes]
ValidateClick --> |No| End([Ignore])
RemoveActive --> AddActive[Add Active to Clicked]
AddActive --> GetFilter[Get Filter Value]
GetFilter --> LoopItems[Loop Through Items]
LoopItems --> CheckCategory{Matches Category?}
CheckCategory --> |Yes| ShowItem[Display Item]
CheckCategory --> |No| HideItem[Hide Item]
ShowItem --> NextItem{More Items?}
HideItem --> NextItem
NextItem --> |Yes| LoopItems
NextItem --> |No| TrackEvent[Track Filter Event]
TrackEvent --> End
```

## Accordion Toggles

The accordion system provides expandable content sections for service details and product examples, featuring smooth animations and proper ARIA state management for accessibility compliance.

### Toggle State Management

Each accordion toggle maintains its expanded/collapsed state through ARIA attributes and CSS classes, ensuring consistent behavior across different interaction methods.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User as User
participant Button as Toggle Button
participant Content as Content Area
participant Icon as Toggle Icon
User->>Button : Click
Button->>Button : Check aria-expanded
alt Expanded
Button->>Button : Set aria-expanded="false"
Button->>Content : Remove .expanded class
Button->>Icon : Remove .rotated class
else Collapsed
Button->>Button : Set aria-expanded="true"
Button->>Content : Add .expanded class
Button->>Icon : Add .rotated class
end
Button->>Button : Track event
```

ValidateBrowser --> |Yes| ShowDialog[Show Modal Dialog]
ValidateBrowser --> |No| ShowFallback[Show Fallback Modal]
ShowDialog --> UserInput[User Fills Form]
ShowFallback --> UserInput
UserInput --> ValidateForm{Valid Input?}
ValidateForm --> |No| ShowError[Show Error Message]
ValidateForm --> |Yes| PrepareData[Prepare Lead Data]
PrepareData --> SendCRM[Send to CRM Webhook]
SendCRM --> TrackEvent[Track Submission Event]
TrackEvent --> CloseModal[Close Modal]
CloseModal --> ShowSuccess[Show Success Alert]
ShowError --> UserInput
```
