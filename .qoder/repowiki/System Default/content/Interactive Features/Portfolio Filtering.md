## Introduction

The portfolio filtering mechanism is a sophisticated interactive system that allows users to browse through 48 video projects categorized into six distinct industries. The system combines HTML data attributes, JavaScript event handling, CSS animations, and analytics tracking to create a seamless user experience for navigating corporate video content.

The filtering system operates on a category-based model where each video is tagged with a specific industry classification, and users can instantly filter the portfolio by selecting from predefined categories including Industry, Brand Films, Events, Travel, Sports, PR, New Projects, and All Projects.

## Filter Button Architecture

### HTML Structure and Data Attributes

The filter interface consists of eight strategically positioned buttons arranged in a responsive grid layout. Each button utilizes the `data-filter` attribute to establish its relationship with specific video categories.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class FilterButton {
+string data-filter
+boolean active
+HTMLElement element
+handleClick() void
+updateState() void
}
class CaseFilters {
+FilterButton[] buttons
+string selectedCategory
+initialize() void
+bindEvents() void
}
class CaseItem {
+string data-category
+HTMLElement element
+string displayStyle
+show() void
+hide() void
}
FilterButton --> CaseFilters : "belongs to"
CaseItem --> CaseFilters : "filtered by"
CaseFilters --> CaseItem : "controls visibility"
```

- [assets/main.js](file://assets/main.js#L150-L170)

Each filter button contains a structured composition of elements designed for optimal accessibility and visual hierarchy:

- **Icon Element**: Small brand logo (18px height) with opacity controls
- **Text Content**: Category name in uppercase with proper spacing
- **Container**: Flexible layout supporting responsive design

### Button State Management

The system implements a dynamic state management approach where only one button can be active at any given time. The active state is visually communicated through background color changes, text color modifications, and icon brightness adjustments.

## Video Segments Object Structure

### Data Organization and Categories

The `videoSegments` object serves as the central data hub for organizing 48 video projects across seven distinct categories. This structure enables efficient filtering operations and maintains data integrity throughout the application lifecycle.

```mermaid
erDiagram
VIDEO_SEGMENTS {
object industry
object brand
object events
object travel
object sport
object pr
object other
object new
object all
}
INDUSTRY_VIDEOS {
string video_id
string category "industry"
}
BRAND_VIDEOS {
string video_id
string category "brand"
}
EVENTS_VIDEOS {
string video_id
string category "events"
}
TRAVEL_VIDEOS {
string video_id
string category "travel"
}
SPORT_VIDEOS {
string video_id
string category "sport"
}
PR_VIDEOS {
string video_id
string category "pr"
}
VIDEO_SEGMENTS ||--o{ INDUSTRY_VIDEOS : contains
VIDEO_SEGMENTS ||--o{ BRAND_VIDEOS : contains
VIDEO_SEGMENTS ||--o{ EVENTS_VIDEOS : contains
VIDEO_SEGMENTS ||--o{ TRAVEL_VIDEOS : contains
VIDEO_SEGMENTS ||--o{ SPORT_VIDEOS : contains

### Data Integrity and Fallback Systems

The system implements robust fallback mechanisms to ensure uninterrupted functionality even when sessionStorage data becomes unavailable. The fallback mechanism automatically reconstructs the video segments object with pre-defined categories and empty arrays for categories without content.

## JavaScript Implementation

### Filter Event Handler Architecture

The JavaScript implementation follows a modular approach with dedicated event handlers for filter button interactions. The system employs event delegation patterns and efficient DOM manipulation techniques to maintain optimal performance during rapid user interactions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User as "User Click"
participant Button as "Filter Button"
participant Handler as "Event Handler"
participant DOM as "DOM Elements"
participant Tracker as "Analytics Tracker"
User->>Button : Click filter button
Button->>Handler : Trigger click event
Handler->>Handler : Remove active class from all buttons
Handler->>Button : Add active class to clicked button
Handler->>DOM : Get all case items
Handler->>DOM : Iterate through items
DOM->>Handler : Check category match
Handler->>DOM : Set display style (grid/block)
Handler->>Tracker : Log filter interaction
Tracker-->>User : TrackEvent fired
```

- [portfolio.html](file://portfolio.html#L350-L370)

### Active State Management Algorithm

The active state management follows a strict one-active-button policy where the system systematically removes the 'active' class from all buttons before applying it to the newly selected button. This ensures consistent visual feedback and prevents user confusion.

The algorithm operates with O(n) complexity where n represents the total number of filter buttons, maintaining predictable performance regardless of the button count.

### Case Item Visibility Control

The visibility control system employs a dual-condition evaluation mechanism that considers both the selected filter category and the individual item's category attribute. The system supports two primary display modes:

- **Show Mode**: Items matching the selected category or "all" category are displayed
- **Hide Mode**: Items not matching the selected category are hidden

This approach ensures that users can quickly navigate through specific categories while maintaining the ability to view all content when needed.

### Hash-Based Navigation System

The system implements a sophisticated hash-based navigation system that automatically applies filters based on URL fragments. This feature enhances usability by allowing direct links to specific categories and maintaining filter state across page refreshes.

## CSS Styling and Visual States

### Filter Button Design System

The filter button styling implements a comprehensive design system that communicates state changes through multiple visual cues including background colors, border styles, text colors, and icon transformations.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
Normal["Normal State<br/>Background: var(--card)<br/>Border: var(--line)<br/>Text: var(--text)<br/>Icon: opacity: 0.8"] --> Hover["Hover State<br/>Background: var(--bg)<br/>Border: var(--brand)<br/>Transform: translateY(-2px)"]
Hover --> Active["Active State<br/>Background: var(--brand)<br/>Text: #111<br/>Border: var(--brand)<br/>Icon: opacity: 1, brightness: 0.2"]
Normal -.->|Mouse Leave| Normal
Hover -.->|Click| Active
Active -.->|Select Other| Normal
```

**Diagram sources**
- [assets/styles.css](file://assets/styles.css#L280-L295)

### Color Palette and Accessibility

The color palette is carefully designed to meet accessibility standards while maintaining brand consistency. The active state uses a high-contrast combination of brand color (#B09B7E) against dark text (#111) to ensure optimal readability across various display conditions.

## Performance Considerations

### Rendering Optimization Strategies

For applications handling large numbers of portfolio items, several optimization strategies can be implemented to maintain smooth user experience:

#### Virtual Scrolling Implementation
- **Benefit**: Reduces DOM tree depth by rendering only visible items
- **Implementation**: Limit initial render to 12-15 items with lazy loading
- **Performance Gain**: Up to 90% reduction in initial render time

#### Debounced Filter Operations
- **Benefit**: Prevents excessive re-rendering during rapid user interactions
- **Implementation**: Apply 100ms debounce to filter event handlers
- **Performance Impact**: Eliminates flickering during quick button switching

#### Efficient DOM Queries
- **Benefit**: Minimizes layout thrashing and repaint cycles
- **Implementation**: Cache DOM references and batch DOM updates
- **Optimization**: Reduce query operations from O(n²) to O(n)

### Memory Management Best Practices

#### Event Listener Cleanup
- **Problem**: Accumulation of unused event listeners
- **Solution**: Implement proper cleanup in component unmount
- **Impact**: Prevents memory leaks in single-page applications

#### Image Preloading Strategies
- **Benefit**: Improves perceived performance during navigation
- **Implementation**: Load thumbnail images before full content
- **User Experience**: Smooth transitions between categories

## Event Tracking System

### Analytics Integration Architecture

The portfolio filtering system integrates with a comprehensive analytics framework that tracks user interactions for business intelligence and conversion optimization.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
FilterClick["Filter Button Click"] --> TrackEvent["trackEvent()"]
TrackEvent --> DataLayer["window.dataLayer"]
DataLayer --> GA4["Google Analytics 4"]
DataLayer --> Yandex["Yandex.Metrica"]
TrackEvent --> EventParams["Parameters:<br/>category: 'Cases'<br/>action: 'filter'<br/>label: 'selected_category'"]
```

**Diagram sources**

### Tracking Parameter Structure

The `trackEvent` function implements a standardized parameter structure that enables comprehensive analytics reporting:

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **category** | "Cases" | Event category for segmentation |
| **action** | "filter" | Specific action performed |
| **label** | Selected filter category | Detailed event context |
